# solarModuleScaledDXFDemo

Demo for using dxf-writer for printing a dxf file with panels scaled by roof pitch

Many Solar companies use AutoCad as their tool for drawing solar layouts on homes.
This solves solar module scaling issues for pitched roofs.
Given the module base dimensions and desired angles, this will generate a dxf file of accurate module sizes with the y scaled to the pitches provided.
Users can then copy or import the modules into their cad projects.
